Compiler
========

I've created this project for self-educational purposes of understanding how compilers work. I do have the
added incentive of wanting to create my own programming language and thought, what better place to start
than programming your own compiler.

I decided to do this in Java. The reference that I used to build this project was the infamous work of art
known as the Dragon Book. Majority of the code however is mine. I merely used the book as a tool for learning
and understanding the science behind compilers.
